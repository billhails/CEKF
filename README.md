# CEKF
Low level (C) implementation of a CEK machine with an additional "F" failure continuation supporting amb.

This is heavily based on a blog post by Matt Might [Writing an interpreter, CESK-style](https://matt.might.net/articles/cesk-machines/).

I tasked myself with learning enough Haskell to bridge the gap between the math and real code, and then implemented in C.

Currently there is only an A-Normal syntax tree with constructors, the CEKF machine itself which can evaluate those trees,
and a basic mark & sweep garbage collector. I plan to follow up with a lexer/parser (probably Bison/Flex but maybe a hand-written Pratt parser).
Then a type checker (Hindley Milner), and finally a converter to generate the A-Normal form structures from the syntax tree generated by the parser.

I'm hoping that I can reproduce the language I once implemented in Python [Here](https://github.com/billhails/PyScheme), but as a standalone
binary with reasonable performance.

If you want to look around, maybe start by reading the [math](CEKF.pdf) and comparing that with its implementation in [`step.c`](src/step,c)
