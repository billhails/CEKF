not always very useful being a bit difficult to read but for the sake of
completeness:

* [anf](anf.md) A-Normal form structures input to the bytecode compiler.
* [ast](ast.md) Abstract Syntax Tree output from the parser.
* [builtins](builtins.md) Support for builtin functions.
* [lambda](lambda.md) Plain Lambda intermediate code generated from the AST.
* [tc](tc.md) Type Checking support data structures
* [tpmc](tpmc.md) Support structures for the Term Pattern Matching Compiler.
