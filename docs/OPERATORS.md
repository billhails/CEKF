# Operators (and macros)

Some issues with the initial implementation.

I'd thought I could get away with a pure parser-only implementation of
infix operators and it basically works, but there are some issues which
make that approach quite clunky.  One specific scenario is where I'm
declaring an infix addition operator in the preamble as:

```
infix left 100 "+" addition;
```

Where `addition` is the symbol for the two-argument built-in addition
operator. Trouble is in another file I'd redefined `addition` as a type
of expression for unrelated purposes, and because i.e. `2 + 2` gets
re-written to plain old `addition(2, 2)` unconditionally, in that context
the interpreter finds the `addition` type from the current environment
rather than the one where the infix operator was declared.

This is clearly unacceptable.

[Hygenic Macros in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygienic_macro) states:

This offers hope, if we can re-work the macro system to be hygenic by default,
then the parser instead of generating
`addition(a, b)` for `a + b` could instead generate:

```
macro gensym$1(a, b) { addition(a, b) }
```

at the point of the operator declaration, and generate `gensym$1(a, b)`
when `a + b` is subsequently encountered.

Firstly I now think the use of a `$` prefix to indicate a gensym in a macro
is not the best idea. Instead the lambda conversion should identify bound
`let` variables and replace them automatically. That also frees up `$` as a
potentially useful user-defined prefix operator.

The bigger problem is that we can't continue to do naiive macro expansion during
the lambda conversion step, or we'd be back where we started with
`addition(a, b)` referring to whatever `addition` happens to be the current
definition.

We may have to revert to the scheme definition of a macro: pass the arguments
unevaluated to the macro, evaluate the macro body, then re-evaluate the result.

But we really don't want to have the macro evaluated like that, because Fâ™® is not
homoiconic, "evaluating the macro body" can only mean substitution.

What if the arguments to macros were wrapped in a closure?

```
macro AND(a, b) { if (a) { b } else { false } } => fn AND(a, b) { if (a()) { b() } else { false } }

AND(a, b) => AND(fn () { a }, fn () { b })
```

That would definately work, though it won't be quite as efficient. It solves both
local scoping rules, since `AND` is now a normal function then free variables in the
body are evaluated in the context of the function definition, and variables in the
argument expressions are evaluated in the calling context.

Got that working, and we're also handling local shadowing of arguments so they don't
get wrapped in an invocation unless they are the same lexical variable.

One little unnecssary inefficiency needs to be addressed. If one macro calls another,
for example

```
macro NAND(a, b) { NOT(AND(a, b)) }
```

This first gets rewritten, by `lambda_conversion.c` to

```
fn NAND(a, b) { NOT(AND(fn () {a}, fn () {b})) }
```

and then subsequently by `macro_substitution.c` to

```
fn NAND(a, b) { NOT(AND(fn () {a()}, fn () {b()})) }
```

While correct, the expression `fn () {a()}` is just `a` so we'll need
a pass to optimise away this unnecessary wrapping and unwrapping,
essentially restoring

```
fn NAND(a, b) { NOT(AND(a, b)) }
```

Two approaches:

1. Macro specific, have a special type for macro argument application
   and another for macro argument wrapping, and detect the explicit
   combination of the two.
2. Generic pass that would detect this wherever it occurs and optimize it.

In either case we need to be a little bit careful that we allow the
pattern if the argument is being modified, for example if a macro
called another with it's argument modified in some way then the pattern
i.e. `fn() { a() + 1 }` would be necessary.

Got option 1 working, but no need for extra types, just inspect the
thunk during macro conversion, if it has no arguments and just contains
a symbol that would otherwise be invoked then return the symbol.
