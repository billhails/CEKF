            description: >-
                The environment contains a table of types, a table of type signatures,
                and a reference to the next environment in the chain.
        data:
            table: TcTypeTable

            brief: Non-generic variables
            description: >-
                Variables bound as function arguments while in the body of
                a function definition. These are not generic variables.

    TcFunction:
        meta:
            brief: Function type
            description: >-
                Represents a function type `a -> b` with an argument type
                and a result type. Laziness is now expressed via explicit
                thunk types in the argument.
        data:
            arg: TcType
            result: TcType

    TcPair:

            brief: Pair type
            description: >-
                Represents a pair of types, used for tuples and other
                pair-like structures.

            brief: Thunk type
            description: >-
                Represents a thunk (delayed computation) type `thunk(a)`, which
                is equivalent to `() -> a`. Used for lazy evaluation where
                computation is deferred until explicitly forced. Displays as
                `(#() => a)` in type signatures.

                Represents a type signature with a name, arguments,
                and a nameSpace.  It is used to define types in the
                type-checker.

            description: >-
                Represents a type variable, which can be used in type signatures
                and type inference. It has a name, an ID, and an optional instance
                if it is bound to a type.
