            description: >-
                A Trie is a tree of tokens indexed by character. It is used to
                parse the input stream and build a parse tree. The root node
                has the first character, siblings are alternatives at the current level,
                and the children are indexed by subsequent characters of the token.
                Ordering of siblings ensures efficient search and insertion.
